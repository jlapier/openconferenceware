Changes
=======

OpenConferenceWare stable releases and changes included, with latest at top:

* v0.20100408
- SECURITY flaw fixed: The buggy "restful_authentication" plugin used by OpenConferenceWare and OpenProposals let users without email addresses that had used the "remember me" feature to sometimes login as other users without email addresses that had also used the "remember me" feature during the same day. All known operators running this software were notified and sent patches in advance of this notification. Because authentication was handled by OpenID, a compromise could not be escalated and there was no password to steal, the worst thing an attacker could do was edit your profile and proposals.
- FIXED handling of multiple events: reworked layout, header, menu, favorites, tracks, etc.
- FIXED autoincrement id in the events table, which could prevent creation of new events.
- FIXED "rake setup:sample" to work with an empty database.
- FIXED exception handling to display clearer messages and correctly handle rendering errors in the layout.
- FIXED "/events/EVENTID/proposals/stats" to use per-event caching.
- CHANGED Gem dependencies to use Bundler. You must install the "bundler" gem and run "bundle install" to install the application's dependencies. If you're using the Capistrano deploy task, install Bundler and its "deploy" task will automatically install the other dependencies.
- CHANGED "bridgepdx" theme for 2010, it uses a new menu that provides a way to choose events and their associated data.
- Added shared fragments to provide a common heaer for Rails app, WordPress blog and wikis, these are local files that are included into these different applications.
- Added task to update thumbnails: `rake paperclip:refresh CLASS=User`
- Added factory_girl library, factories and additional specs.

* v0.20100218
- FIXED event-related checks to use a proposal's event when possible,
  rather than the current event, since these aren't always the same.
- FIXED scrolling to a specific field on the admin's "Manage event" page.
- Added #scroll_to helper, which scrolls the page to an HTML element.
- Added "cap db:use" task to dump and download remote database and
  restore it locally.
- Improved "rake db:raw:*" tasks to support proper database dump and
  restore for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3.
- Upgraded to jQuery 1.3.2 and jwysiwyg 0.6.

* v0.20100206.1
- FIXED rake use when not running the "test" environment.

* v0.20100206

- FIXED Event#underway? typo that would throw exception in schedule.
- Improved Proposal's session notes wiki linkage to use flexible URLs.
- Improved Proposal's export to iCalendar to include a time zone.
- Improved Room, added picture of room.
- Improved Proposal to only sort in a few specific ways.
- Improved DeferProxy, made it simpler and more transparent.

* v0.20090616

- FIXED bug that showed proposal statuses (e.g., "Accepted session")
  before these statues were published. They're now only shown if the
  Admin sets the "Proposal statuses published?" flag on an event.
- FIXED the login "remember me" feature. Previously it was ignored.
- FIXED proposals feeds. Made top-level "/proposal.atom" and
  event-specific "/events/2009/proposals.atom" feed. Also fixed the feed
  article timestamps so proposals aren't relisted if edited.
- FIXED the views to use "record-controls" wrappers around controls.
- CHANGED logic for finding the current event: first try using the
  "settings.yml" file's "current_event_slug" field and find an event
  with a matching slug, else use the old latest-deadline logic. Setting
  a current event is necessary if you have multiple open events and want
  a specific one to respond to URLs like "/proposals".
- CHANGED anonymous user's label from something like "myopenid.com" to
  "User #123 at myopenid.com", which is much clearer.
- CHANGED "rake db:dump" and "rake db:restore" to "rake db:raw:dump" and
  "rake db:raw:restore" to avoid collisions with YamlDB.
- Improved "rake db:raw:dump" and "rake db:raw:restore" to support both
  SQLite and MySQL.
- Improved proposal form, if an event has a single track or session
  type, it's used as the default and no UI is shown. This helps child
  events, e.g., parent has many tracks, child has one track.
- Improved events, added parent/child relationships between them. Change
  these these associations via the Admin's manage events UI.
- Added user favorites, these show up as stars next to all proposals.
- Added speaker list, e.g., "/events/2009/speakers".
- Improved display of sublists (e.g., a user's sessions and proposals).
  These list links back to sessions and display favorites.
- Improved CSV exports for proposals and added these to speakers.
- Improved session sidebox, added room and scheduling information.

* v0.20090605

- FIXED schema/migrations for MySQL, it was truncating important columns
  to 255 characters. This fix upgrades these "varchar(255)" columns to
  "text": proposal descriptions, schedule items excerpts and
  descriptions, snippets descriptions, and tracks descriptions. If you
  were using SQLite, you were not affected by this bug.

* v0.20090524

- FIXED layout, it no longer raises an exception if there's no event.
- FIXED cache expiration, it no longer raises an exception if called
  when there's no cache directory.
- FIXED events#index and events#show, they now keep flash notifications,
  these were previously getting discarded.
- FIXED schedule, it now only displays proposals that are confirmed and
  scheduled, previously it displayed proposals that were just scheduled.
- Added event slugs. These provide unique string identifiers for events
  (e.g., "2009bof"), rather the old integer identifiers (e.g., 2009).
- Improved proposal's admin UI, the room and schedule controls are only
  shown if the proposal is in a confirmed state.
- Added new CSV export system that provides more flexible exporting.
- Added DeferProxy, a clearer way to defer expensive queries.

* v0.20090516

- Added schedule. It can be displayed as HTML or imported as iCalendar
  and hCalendar data. New admin interfaces provide ways to create and
  manage ScheduleItems, non-session scheduled items such as a lunch
  break, and toggle whether the schedule is available to the public. A
  new "schedule:import:google_spreadheet" rake task is provided for
  importing schedule data from Google Spreadsheets as an alternative to
  using the per-item and bulk edit interfaces for setting the schedule.
- Improved the ProposalsController#sort_proposals method to use
  arguments rather than params, making it much easier to use and extend.
- Improved Track color handling with Color objects to make fancy color
  transformations easy.

* v0.20090514

- FIXED lookup of current event when no events where in the database.
- FIXED compatibility with Ruby 1.8.6p111, which doesn't have Enumerable#count.
- Added association from rooms to events.
- Added "rake export:speakers" task.

* v0.20090505
- FIXED bug introduced by new ruby-openid and passengerl libraries that broke logins.
- FIXED bug introduced by new RubyGems library that broke Time::today.
- Refactored sorting and caching code used by proposals#index and
  proposals#sessions_index. Added specs.
- Added "rake tags" task that automatically uses ctags or rtags.
- Added initial support for publishing schedule as iCalendar.

* v0.20090425
- Added support for displaying sessions differently than proposals.
- Added heavy caching to proposals and sessions indexes.
- Added helpers to display main and sub navigation based on proposal
  status and portion of the site being used.
- Improved user profiles, added Twitter and Identi.ca handles, and Blog URL.
- Improved proposals, sessions and schedule, if non-admin visits these
  paths before status is published, they'll be redirected away.
- Improved NormalizeUrlMixin to validate multiple URLs at once.
- Improved boot, added check that ensures migrations have been applied.
- Improved documentation.

* v0.20090416
- FIXED login to work with current versions of ruby_openid and Passenger.
- FIXED schema, made it compatible with other databases. SQLite was too lax.
- HACKED proposal#edit, allowing owners to edit forever. This will be revised.
- Improved manage/events#proposals, added display of proposal counts by
- status to bulk editor.
- Improved proposal#edit, added instructions for asking other speakers to
  complete their profile so they can be added.
- Improved users#show, added a "me" route for accessing current user's profile
  via </users/me>.
- Added users#complete_profile, which provides a way to complete a person's
  profile, typically offered as link to </users/me/complete_profile>.
- Improved database support, added MySQL. See
  "config/database~mysql.sample.yml" for sample.
- Improved caching support, added memcache. See
  "lib/rails_cache_configurator.rb" for details.
- Improved caching, added many caches and eliminated many queries.
- Added "rake clear:cache" task which empties memcache or filesystem caches.

* v0.20090412
- Improved logit, made it more efficient by avoiding calls based on log level.
- Added cucumber specifications for comments.
